"""Crop cascade orchestration.

Mirrors the cropAttempts waterfall from script-frontend's imageProcessor.js
but restricted to strategies that run server-side (macOS Swift croppers stay
client-side).

Every cropping strategy — including the client-supplied `precropped` —
flows through the SAME two-gate check, so adding a new cropper (MobileSAM,
classical contour, ...) is just a matter of appending to `_STRATEGIES`.
The gates are applied in the wrapper, not in each strategy, so a new
cropper can't accidentally skip fallback logic.

Gates (applied to every strategy uniformly):

1. **Geometric validation** (`validator.is_plausible_crop`) — min size,
   aspect ratio within tolerance, area fraction vs. source, non-blank
   stddev. Rejects technically malformed crops.

2. **Text-count regression guard** — the baseline is orient's text count
   on the raw passthrough. A cropper's output must retain at least
   `MIN_CASCADE_TEXT_RATIO` of that baseline, or the stage is rejected.
   Catches wrong-region crops that *happen* to be card-shaped.

If every strategy fails, the passthrough fallback carries whatever
orient+classify produced on the raw image. The client can surface an
empty-players / null-card_number response as "preprocess couldn't
identify this card" and route to a manual path upstream.

Source labels (order of preference):
    precropped      : client-supplied crop, or the raw upload as fallback
    pil_trim_dark   : PIL blur + threshold + trim (card lighter than bg)
    pil_trim_light  : PIL blur + threshold + trim (card darker than bg)
    sam             : SAM ViT-B semantic segmentation
    haiku_bbox      : Anthropic Haiku bounding-box crop
    passthrough     : raw image forwarded unchanged
